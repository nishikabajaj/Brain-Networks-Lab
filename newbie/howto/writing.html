<h2>Content</h2>

It is easy to make the mistake that what is obvious to you (the author)
is obvious to everyone. It is also easy to just describe what you did,
but neglect to say why. You'd be amazed how many papers get rejected
just because of that, even if the research is otherwise perfectly good.

Writing a paper is actually surprisingly simple. There is a small set of
questions you need to address; if you do that, the readers will get what
they want. Like this:

<UL>
<LI>
What is the big issue to which you want to contribute?<br>
   e.g. to understand how human episodic memory is put together.
<p>

<LI>
What is already known about it?<br>
   i.e. the state of the art, or related work.
<p>

<LI>
What is not known about it?<br>
   There may be several such topics; your topic will be one of them.
<p>

<LI>
Where did you get your idea?<br>
   i.e. what motivates it, why do you think it will work?<br>
   e.g. there's this recent new technique in another area...
<p>

<LI>
What is your hypothesis?<br>
   e.g. that this new technique can be used to solve this old problem.
<p>

<LI>
How did you test your hypothesis?<br>
   E.g. build a computational model and match with human data?
<p>

<LI>
How did the results turn out?<br>
   e.g. they showed that the idea works, and in addition you got one or
   two other results that go beyond it and generate future work.
<p>

<LI>
What do they mean?<br>
   i.e. what do we know now that we didn't know before?<br>
   Or: How is the world a better place after you've done this research?
</ul>


Above all, the above list is a detailed outline of the introduction for
your paper. You can follow it pretty much as it is. It also serves as a
guideline to the abstract, although you have to be much more brief in
the abstract. Finally, it is the list of topics you will discuss in
the later sections. 


<h2><a name="organization">Organization</a></h2>

A typical outline of the main sections is:

<UL>
<LI>
Abstract
<LI>
1. Introduction
<LI>
2. Background/Related Work/Research Base
<LI>
3. Approach/Model/Architecture
<LI>
4. Experiments (Setup, Results)
<LI>
5. Discussion and Future Work
<LI>
6. Conclusion
<LI>
Acknowledgements (grants)
<LI>
References
</UL>

The abstract is intended to be a short summary of the paper that a
person can read and understand without reading the whole paper. It
should follow the same structure as the intro (see the first list
above). Do not forget to say how the results turned out and what they
mean. Be specific and give content, not just a list of the main
sections.
<p>

Each of sections 2-5 should do the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Say what you are going to say in this section, i.e. which of the
   above questions it will answer. Use lists: "There are three main
   theories of X: (1)...(2)...(3). I will review each one it turn, and
   point out what their successes and shortcomings are."
   (In LaTeX, the <a href="/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/styles/paralist.dvi">
   paralist</a> package can typeset and keep track of such lists.)
  
<p>

<LI>
Then discuss each of the topics. Make it clear where you are.
   "The second main theory of X is Y..."
<p>

<LI>
Conclude: What did you establish in this section? What does it mean?
   "Although these theories are good at explaining X, they have not
   shown how Y..."
</UL>

In Discussion you evaluate what has been established by doing the
research, what the limitations are, what the contributions are, and how
your work advances the state of the art. The limitations lead naturally
to future work (which is sometimes part of Discussion, sometimes a
separate section, depending on the emphasis of the paper). Do not be shy
or protective of your ideas: if someone else goes and does what
you proposed, all the better for you.
<p>

Conclusion should really conclude, i.e. you should step back and
evaluate the main results in the context of the big picture: what your
results were, how they contribute to the big issue, and what can be
done in the future building on this work. It is not a summary.
<p>

You should also use subsections; that way it is easier for the reader to
put it all together. Each subsection should cover one coherent topic,
typically about a 1/3-1/2 page in length (in a double column format). If
you have subsections, you should also have an intro paragraph in the
main section saying what they are.

<h2>The process of writing</h2>

Writing papers is a bit of work, but you get better with practice. There
are two principles that allow you to write the paper with the least
amount of effort and iteration: the "iterative deepening" principle, and
the "outward expansion" principle:
<p>

In "iterative deepening", you'll start by putting together a high-level
outline consisting of the above main sections.  Then put in each of the
above main questions: they should be your outline for the abstract and
intro, and each question should also be included in the outline for the
main text. Then start expanding the outline, gradually adding more and
more detail (using the "outward expansion" principle below). Once you
have a note for each paragraph, you can start writing out the paper in
actual words.
<p>

In "outward expansion", you start the writing from the middle of the
paper and expand towards the beginning and the end. That is, you first
write the description of the architecture/model/approach, experiments,
and results. Those are easy to write because they are very
concrete. After that, write the background/related work/research base,
once you know what is relevant. Then go on to discussion and future
work, and then to the intro and the conclusion, once you know what the
paper is all about. The last thing to write is the abstract, after you
are done with everything else. As you write, you may come up with ideas
to be included in the other sections, and you should add them to the
outline, to be expanded later.
<p>

Typically, you should utilize both principles: you'll start with a
complete high-level outline, and in every iteration, you'll deepen it by
expanding out from the middle. When you first write it out with actual
words, don't worry too much about expressing everything in perfect
form: it is more important to just get the ideas on paper. After the
whole paper is done, you'll read and edit it a few times and polish it
up.
<p>

Polishing up the expression is important. Above all, write plain
English; the reviewers have to read 10 papers in 2 hours (or something
like that), and they are not going to be impressed by long, complicated
sentences; they will simply not read them. Use strong verbs, and avoid
complex noun groups.
<p>

Use a lot of figures and tables to illustrate your ideas. Explain the
main points of each figure/table in the text, and the details (that are
necessary to actually understand the figure) in the caption. Also repeat
the main point of the figure in the caption. It should be possible to
just look at the figures and get an idea what the paper is about.
<p>

Each of the main ideas that is not your own should be referenced,
sometimes with a couple of references. It serves to show that you know
the area, and also that your own ideas are based on existing, well-known
work, which makes them more believable. Clearly indicate in the paper,
however, which of the ideas are yours.
<p>

<h2>Further Reading</h2>

There are several good books on writing style and how to put together
scholarly articles. Try for example Strunk and White: 
<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/">"The Elements of Style"</a>, 
or van Leunen: "A Handbook for Scholars". I have both of these
and although they are rather old, they still have lots of useful
tips. You can find several newer ones in the library. Also check out the
suggestions on the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/gracs/gracs-graduating.html">Gracs
graduating</a> page, and the <a
href="http://www.med.yale.edu/library/reference/publications/writing.html">Yale
Med library page</a>. Bill Starbuck's collection of <a
href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~wstarbuc/Writing/">writing tips</a> is
also very useful, as is Mark Leone's collection of <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/how-to.html">advice
on research and writing</a>.  Jim has also put together a <a
href="techwriting.html">collection of tips</a> gleaned from grading
the CS technical writing course, which may be helpful.<p>
