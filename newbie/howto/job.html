<h2> Types of jobs </h2>

Your most important task in grad school is to get a good job when you
graduate. Many people are aiming at an assistant professor position in a
research university; that's a natural continuation of your
career. There's a small number of such jobs, but you only need one, and
if you are lucky, you can get one right off the bat.<p>

Given that the outcome of your job search to a large extent depends on
luck, it makes sense to spread your bets over a couple of
years. Sometimes people test the waters one year, and if a suitable job
doesn't appear, wait another year and try again.  I'd recommend against
putting off graduation for more than a year though. When you are ready,
you should graduate.  There are lots of opportunities that you may not
see until you are getting out. It is perfectly fine to take a postdoc
position for a year or two, or a research job at a major industrial
research lab such as AT&amp;T, NEC, or IBM, a national lab such as Santa Fe
Institute or Los Alamos, or research institute such as SRI, ICSI, Salk,
or ISI. In such jobs, you are doing serious research and building up
your vita, and you can apply again next year or in a couple of years
when a suitable job opens up. In areas such as theory, almost all
assistant profs have had a year or two of postdoc experience, and it is
becoming more common in AI as well.
<p>

You should only take on a job in a teaching school if you really enjoy
teaching and want to do it for a living. It is very hard to get any
research done, and it is very hard to move to a research university from
a teaching job. But if you are happy with teaching, there are several
such jobs available in nice places. <p>

There are lots of good industry jobs out there for neural netters. Many
big research labs compete with universities for candidates, and they
often advertised in the same <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/newsgroups/newsgroups.html">
newsgroups</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/archives/archives.html"> mailing
lists</a>. They are also on the same schedule, so you can apply to them
at the same time as you apply to universities. But you can often get an
industry job much quicker than one in academia, and you can defer
applying until you are almost done.  <p>

<h2> Money </h2>

Someone once calculated that if your goal is to maximize the amount of
money you make in your lifetime, you are better off going to industry
right after your bachelor's: even though you get paid better with a PhD,
you'll never catch up. So that's not why we are here. However, it is
still good to know what kind of salaries to expect, and before you go to
job market, you should find out the latest. The "Computing Research
News" publishes a survey every year on academic salaries in CS: in 1997,
the average beginning assistant prof. salary was about $58,000. At the
same time, the starting salary for a fresh PhD in the industry was about
$85,000. Here's some more <a href="salaries.txt">data on the UTCS Spring
96 graduates</a>.  The absolute numbers are of course out of date, but
they should give you some idea of the relative amounts.

<h2> Applying for faculty positions </h2>

If you are interested in applying for an academic job, you should be
ready to send out applications in late December. Most academic
openings in CS are announced in the October through March issues of
the <a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/cacm/">CACM</a>, and
electronically at the
<a href="http://campus.acm.org/crc/">CACM</a> and the
<a href="http://www.cra.org/main/cra.jobs.html">CRA</a> lists, but you
can always send an application to a school you are interested in even
if you haven't seen an announcement.  For cognitive science or
computational neuroscience jobs, the listings at the
<a href="http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/employ/">Cognitive
Science Society</a>, the <a
href="http://www.visionscience.com/vsJobs.html">Vision Science list</a>,
or the <a href="http://www.sfn.org/classifieds/positions.html">Society for
Neuroscience</a> may also be useful, but often those departments
that are accessible to a computational modeler have already advertised
in the CS-friendly
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/archives/archives.html">
mailing lists</a>.  Be sure to <a href="lingo.html">learn the
lingo</a> so that you can understand the job postings, interviews, etc.


<P>Many people send 30-80 applications and include all schools they
might consider. If you don't apply you won't get a job. It is also
perfectly ok to contact someone in the school that you are interested
and inquire whether they are hiring in your area. Often departments
have very generic ads in the CACM and CRA list even though they have
priorities for certain areas. On the other hand, if the school has
advertised in the relevant
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/newsgroups/newsgroups.html">
newsgroups</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/archives/archives.html">
mailing lists</a>, they are probably seriously hiring in that
area. For ideas about where you might apply, see e.g. the
<a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/beyond/bcrank.htm">US News
and World report rankings</a> and the latest 
<a href="http://cra.org/statistics/nrcstudy2/">
National Academy of Sciences ranking</a> (1993, released 1995), and
<a href="http://www.gradschools.com/listings/menus/comp_sci_menu.html">gradschools.com</a>
and the <a href="http://www.cra.org/Contacts/home.html">Forsythe
list</a> for addresses and other info.
<p>

An application usually consists of a short cover letter and a vita (see
e.g. van Leunen:
<a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0195069544-0">
<i>A Handbook for Scholars</i></a> or 
<a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/academics/gradhandbook/academic_job.pdf">
"Landing an Academic Job"</a> for suggestions on how to put
them together, and
<a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/Applying.For.Jobs/Academic/">UCSD</a>
for examples). You can also send copies of publications or a research
summary to selected places.  The cover letter should just say that you
are applying for an asst. prof. position (or whatever).
The research statement should describe your overall research
philosophy and (especially) your research plans for the
next several years; see 
<a href="http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2002/07/23/2">Science
Magazine's NextWave</a> for more details.
The vita should
be as complete as possible, describe your research in one paragraph, and
it should list your references. Most of the time the members of your
dissertation committee write the letters, but if you know big-name
people elsewhere who like your work, you should ask them too. You need 3
to 6 letters.  Some schools ask letters of reference to be sent along
with the application, but most request them from the references directly
if you make the first cut.  
If you will be applying to several places, consider using the
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/careercenter/services/credentials/">UT
Career Exploration Center service</a> service for holding confidential
copies of your letters and supplying them to institutions as they are
requested.  That way your referees will not have to handle all the 
copying and mailing.
<p>

<h2> Interviews </h2>

In about February through May, you should get invitations for
interviews.  You'll spend about 1.5-2 days in each place, give a
one-hour <a href="jobtalk.txt">talk</a> on your research, and meet with
a lot of people. Even though you may be just finishing your
dissertation, it is important that you have clear plans for what you'd
like to do in the next couple of years. Also, you should be prepared to
make connections with research that other people in the department are
doing. You might want to look at their web pages and find out what's
going on ahead of time. A lot depends on the impression you give while
you are visiting; however, it is also often the case that you are
competing with candidates in other areas, and if you have a strong vita
with a lot of publications etc., it will help your champion in the
department to get you through. Here are some <a
href="http://www.chronicle.com/jobs/2001/02/2001022301c.htm">tips on
interviewing</a> from The Chronicle of Higher Education. (See also
e.g. <a href="http://www.cra.org/CRN/articles/may02/lazowska.html">
Edward Lazowska's 2002 Computing Research News article</a>,
Zanna and Darley, eds., "The Compleat Academic", 1987
(psychology-focused; available at PCL), the American Society for Cell Biology's 
<a href="http://www.ascb.org/publications/research.pdf">guide to
getting a job in biology</a>, and Heiberger,
<a href="http://www.netLibrary.com/urlapi.asp?action=summary&v=1&bookid=17282">
"The Academic Job Search Handbook"</a>, 1996.)
<p>

Once you get offers you usually have a few weeks to decide, although
that time is flexible. At that point you should contact all the other
school that you might consider and ask whether there's a chance they'll
interview you; usually they either invite you right away or tell you to
take the other job. That way you can make a decision without surprises.
<p>

<h2> Starting a job </h2>

Make sure you can <a href="dissertation.html">
finish your dissertation</a> before you start your job, otherwise you
are likely to get into big trouble. If you run out of time, most schools
allow you to defer until January. But don't even think about becoming an
assistant professor and trying to finish your dissertation at the same
time. It is not an option. 
<p>

When you are ready to go, ask me for a copy of George Bekey's "<a
href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/docproject/handbook/section1.9.0.6.html">Assistant
Professor's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" and Gray and Drew's "What They
Didn't Teach You in Graduate School," and check out the Zanna and Darley
book mentioned above.  You might also consider Kathy Barker's
<a href="http://www.cshlpress.com/default.tpl?action=full&cart=103548574012862048&--eqskudatarq=362&newtitle=At%20the%20Helm%3A%20A%20Laboratory%20Navigator">At the Helm: A Laboratory Navigator</a>, though that's 
much more focused on starting biology labs.  It is also important that
early on you identify a senior member in your department who can serve
as your mentor. There's still a lot to learn...which of course makes
it interesting and fun!  <p>
