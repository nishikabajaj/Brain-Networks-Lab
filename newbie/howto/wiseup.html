Subject: Follow-up to last week's seminar

Here are some notes from the next chapter in Claxton's Wise Up book.
I hope this answers some questions from last time.

Scientific creativity has four stages
1. preparation: information gathering, practicing experimentation techniques, 
analyzing concepts, preliminary observations. Often the process at this stage is 
highly social. Successful laboratories have a general air of support, but a 
critical attitude which force members to improve or discard ideas that don't 
measure up. Members have different but overlapping interests. Suprising results 
and odd phenomena tended not to be discarded as a nuisance, or explained away, but 
became objects of discussion, to see if there might be something of interest to be 
explored.
2. incubation: only once an impasse has been reached. At this stage too much 
communication can be a hindrance
3. illumination: the desired result of stage 2; it can come abrupt or slowly. 
Paying attention and not getting distracted by discussing the problem with others 
at this stage seems to be most successful. People whose minds go blank for a few 
moments, and who have short periods in which they can find nothing to report about 
their own mental process, are more likely to receive illumination.
4. verification: effortful, focused and social. Does the idea hold water? What 
further tests are needed? What findings are left unaccounted for?

There are several rythms of moving between hard and soft thinking.
1. small pauses of 30 seconds or so to gather your thoughts
2. hunch breaks of a few minutes in the middle of a protracted period of focused 
problem-solving such as a long meeting.
3. playtime: time set aside everyday for quiet observation, and for soft as well 
as hard thinking. (This may include physical activity such as bike riding or 
gardening)
4. vacation, especially when the time is spent getting ideas from other fields 
(e.g. an economist reading a biology book on vacation).

When is it a good idea to give the intellect a rest?
1. When you recognize you have hit a roadblock or an impasse.
2. When it looks as if the solution to the problem might involve a kind of 
perceptual reorganization.
3. When the block may be one of your own unconscious assumptions.
4. When a significant part of the data for the problem is no easy to put into words.
5. When there may be a significant disparity between the extent of your relevant 
experience and your ability to articulate it.
6. When the parameters of the situation are not clearly defined, so that you don't 
know what concepts or considerations are going to be relevant or useful.
7. When the situation involves too much complexity: too many factors varying too 
fast or interacting in ways too complicated for the intellects to grasp.
(Claxton, Wise up, p. 169)

Importantly, know-how (practical intelligence) is not related to IQ.
